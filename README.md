# Computational Photography by Example

Computational photography by example. Includes math and code basics. May include exercises for the user. May also include implementation in more than one language.

## Outline (corresponds to UW-Madison's CS534 syllibus)

- Linear algebra basics
- Image processing
- Edge detection
- Object recognition (using SIFT)
- Image alignment and panorama creation
- Face detection
- Image segmentation
- Radiometry and reflectance
- Photometric Stereo
- Shape from focus/defocus
- Camera calibration and shape from stereo
- Shape from uncalibrated steroe
- Structure from motion
- Deep learning for 'visual recognition'
- Optical flow and motion measurement
- Image tracking
- Shape from structured light and time-of-flight
